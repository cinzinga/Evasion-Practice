# Evasion-Practice #

A place for me to test various evasion techniques written in C#. The base code will remain the constant while the evasion techniques utilized will vary. Each sample will be submitted to [antiscan.me](https://antiscan.me) and the number of detections will be recorded here.

### 00-BaseCode.cs ###
The base code that will remain constant across all trials.
